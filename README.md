# Quic-SERP-URL-Copier
A Firefox extension that copies the official URL of selected text using Google's 'I'm Feeling Lucky' feature.

As an SEO specialist, a big part of my job is reviewing and optimizing content.  I constantly found myself needing to quickly find official URLs for sources mentioned by writers â€“ Wikipedia, official organizations, you name it.  Manually Googling every highlighted phrase and then copying the URL was a real time-sink.

That's why I created this Firefox extension! Now, when I'm reviewing content, I just highlight the text, right-click, and "Copy Official URL".  Boom! The first Google result URL is instantly in my clipboard, ready to be added as an authoritative link.  This simple extension has already saved me so much time and streamlined my content optimization workflow. If you're an SEO enthusiast or a content writer, give it a try!
